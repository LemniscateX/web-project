            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Chen Ruinan and Zhaonan, Cantonese returning from America, first proposed raising money from 
                the various Chen lineages to build a temple for worship of their ancestors and an academy to 
                train their clansmen for the imperial examination during the late Qing Dynasty.
                With money donated by Chens abroad and in 72 of Guangdong's counties, the hall was finished 
                in 1894. When the imperial exam was abolished in 1905, 
                the academy became a practical school for members of the clan.<br><br>
                The Guangzhou municipal government approved the hall's status as a special preserve in 1957 and 
                introduced a folk arts and crafts gallery in 1959. During the Cultural Revolution, the artwork of 
                the hall was saved from destruction by "clever local officials" who installed a printshop for 
                publishing works by Mao Zedong.The hall now serves as the Guangdong Folk Art Museum.
