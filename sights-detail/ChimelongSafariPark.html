        <h1>Introduction of <span>Chimelong Safari Park</span></h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>
                Brief introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Chimelong Safari Park near Guangzhou, is truly a great place to spend the day with the kids. 
                Also known as the Xiangjiang Safari Park, it contains an amazing selection of beautiful 
                and exotic animals including the world's largest collection of white tigers, 
                a first-class Giant Panda center, and many protected species like the Giant Salamander.<br><br>
                But undoubtedly the main attraction of Chimelong is currently the set of panda triplets born 
                in the park in mid-2014. These are the only live panda triplets in existence in the world today, 
                a very particular and rare event since chances of survival of panda triplets is only 1%.<br><br>
                There are two parts to this park: the "Safari on Wheels" and the walk-through animal exhibits.<br>
                The Safari on Wheels portion of the park is the "drive-thru" experience. 
                There are trams that will take you around the savannahs, plains, lakes and all the different habitats 
                where the animals roam around freely. Some of the animals get amazingly close,
                kids will love this part. The surroundings are beautifully landscaped and quite remarkable.
                There is also a self-drive option and the entire loop takes about an hour, depending on how much 
                you stop for photographs. The trams will also stop at several points, 
                but not enough if you really want to stick around and watch the animals and photograph them.<br>
                The walk-through or "zoo" part of the park is where all the different habitats and exhibits are. 
                This is where you find the Giant Panda Center and the different theme areas like the African Savannah 
                with the rhinos, hippos, zebras, giraffes, etc, 
                the Australian Outback, where the koalas and kangaroos are, the tropical jungles, etc.
