        <section>
            <h2>Brief introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Canton Tower (Chinese: 广州塔), formally Guangzhou TV Astronomical and Sightseeing Tower (Chinese:
                广州电视台天文及观光塔),
                is a 604 metres (1,982 ft) tall multi-purpose observation tower in the Haizhu District of the city of
                Guangzhou
                (historically known as Canton). The tower was topped out in 2009 and it became operational on 29
                September
                2010
                for the 2010 Asian Games. The tower briefly held the title of tallest tower in the world, replacing the
                CN
                Tower,
                before being surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree. It was the tallest structure in China prior to the topping
                out
                of Shanghai Tower
                on 3 August 2013. It is now the second tallest tower and the fourth-tallest freestanding structure in
                the
                world.

            <h2>Naming and etymology</h2>
            <p>
                There had been a long discussion about the naming of the Canton Tower since the commencement of its
                construction in 2005
                after the groundbreaking ceremony. In September 2009, at the request of the tower's investor,
                Guangzhou Daily launched a contest for naming proposals. The contest attracted over 180,000 valid
                entries,
                among which "Haixin Tower" (Chinese: 海心塔; literally: 'Tower in the Sea') was awarded the first prize.
                The name alluded to the city's historical setting as the start of the Maritime Silk Road
                and the tower's geographical proximity to Haixinsha Island. However,
                this name was considered obscure to people unfamiliar with the history of the city.
                Local residents continued to refer to the tower by various nicknames including "Slim Waist" (Chinese:
                小蛮腰),
                "Twisted Firewood" (Chinese: 扭纹柴; a metaphor for "stubborn" in Cantonese) and "Yangdianfeng" (Chinese:
                羊巅峰;
                literally: 'Peak of the Ram City'; homophonic to "epilepsy" in colloquial Chinese).<br><br>
                The naming was reconsidered in 2010. After surveying a broad range of public opinions,
                "Canton Tower" was decided as the official name and announced at the end of September 2010.
                The new English name, alluded to the city's prosperous past, was considered the most identifying
                and least ambiguous among the multitude of proposals.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Canton Tower was constructed by Guangzhou New Television Tower Group. It is designed by the Dutch
                architects
                Mark Hemel
                and Barbara Kuit of Information Based Architecture, together with Arup, the international design,
                engineering and business
                consulting firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom. In 2004, Information Based Architecture and
                Arup
                won the international
                competition, in which many internationally large architectural offices participated.
                The same year the IBA – Arup team in Amsterdam, developed the tower's concept design.
                In later stages, IBA cooperated mainly with the local Chinese office of Arup and a Local Design
                Institute.
                Subsequently, in 2005, the groundbreaking of the Canton Tower took place.<br><br>
                The tower, although not fully completed, opened to the public on 1 October 2010 in time for the 16th
                Asian
                Games,
                hosted by Guangzhou in November 2010. The rooftop observatory finally received its official
                opening
                in December 2011.

            <h2>Structure and construction</h2>
            <p>
                The Canton tower's twisted shape or hyperboloid structure corresponds to the Russian Empire patent No.
                1896,
                dated 12 March 1899 received by Vladimir Shukhov, the Russian engineer and architect.
                The structure is similar to the Adziogol Lighthouse (designed by Vladimir Shukhov in 1910) in Ukraine's
                Dnepr delta.

            <p>
                As Guangzhou was selected to host the 2010 Asian Games, a small island in front of the tower
